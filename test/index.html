            <h1>The Challenge</h1>
            <p>Did you know that 80% of ocean plastic comes from land, and cities play a huge role?</p>
            <p>Pollution is when something makes the environment unhealthy. The environment is everything around us, like the air we breathe, the water we drink and the land we live on.</p>
            <p>Pollution from cities can harm the ocean and the creatures living in it. Plastic bags, bottles and other rubbish can end up in rivers and eventually in the ocean.</p>
            <p>By reducing waste, recycling right, and choosing eco-friendly options, we can rewrite the story.</p>
